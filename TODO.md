## LAUNCH BLOCKERS (security audit 28/09/2026)

Details, file:line refs and decisions per id in `docs/SECURITY-AUDIT.md`.

All cleared 29/09/2026 (server `b308d17`, client `b62caa9` in production). Last item, prod
email, verified: startup log shows `Email transport ready (smtp.resend.com:465)` and a real
password reset (email -> code -> new password) worked end to end.

## LOW PRIORITY (non-blocking)

- **Monitor agent for production errors.**
  Catch unexpected prod errors, create PR + notify dev, record in a doc, and check if
  recurring — if so, reuse the recorded fix instead of inventing a new one.
